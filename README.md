# Data Type

_Categorical (Qualitative) String_

1. Nominal (Gender) aka Factor/ Genotype  [MAIN EFFECT]
   
   levels - WT, Mutant
   
2. Ordinal (size )

_Numerical (Quantitative) Float/ Integer_

1. Continuous (Decimal) aka Age

2. Discrete (Whole)


# Choose a test based on below parameters

1. Aim
2. Parameter
3. No.of Groups
4. Study Design
5. Distribution
6. Type of Analysis


# Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning (labeled training data)- Class or Label (Classification)

2. Unsupervised Learning (hidden structure from "unlabeled" data)- Numeric or Continuous (Clustering / Recommendation)

## Prediction

The output generated by a machine learning models for a particuolar problem 

There are majorly two kinds of predictions corresponding to two types of problem:

1. Classification (the prediction is mostly a class or label, to which a data points belong)

2. Regression (the prediction is a number, a continous a numeric value, because regression problems deal with predicting the value)
